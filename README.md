**Movie(s)**
**The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Edition)**
- A peaceful hobbit, who is content with living in a distant corner of Middle-Earth, is given a challenge: he must obliterate the Ring of Power to prevent the forces of evil from getting a hold of it. It's Frodo's task in J.R.R Tolkien's famous novel The Lord of the Rings.

**Series**
**Money Heist**
- A.K.A "La casa de papel" or "The House of Paper" is a Spanish heist crime drama television series created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity.
